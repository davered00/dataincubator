LO.PISA.MAT,PISA: Mean performance on the mathematics scale,"Average score of 15-year-old students on the PISA mathematics scale. The metric for the overall mathematics scale is based on a mean for OECD countries of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100 points. Data reflects country performance in the stated year according to PISA reports, but may not be comparable across years or countries. Consult the PISA website for more detailed information: http://www.oecd.org/pisa/",OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
LO.PISA.SCI,PISA: Mean performance on the science scale,"Average score of 15-year-old students on the PISA science scale. In PISA 2006 the mean science score for OECD countries was initially set at 500 points (for 30 OECD countries), then was re-set at 498 points after taking into account new OECD countries. Data reflects country performance in the stated year according to PISA reports, but may not be comparable across years or countries.

OECD.TSAL.1.E0,Annual statutory teacher salaries in public institutions in USD. Primary. Starting salary,"Starting salaries refer to the average scheduled gross salary per year for a full-time teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of the teaching career. Salaries are in equivalent USD converted using PPPs for private consumption. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, while actual salaries refer to the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher. The salaries reported are gross (total sum paid by the employer) less the employer’s contribution to social security and pension, according to existing salary scales. Salaries are “before tax”, i.e. before deductions for income tax. Teachers’ salaries are one component of teachers’ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers’ total remuneration. There are also large differences in taxation and social-benefits systems in OECD countries. All this should be borne in mind when comparing statutory salaries across countries. Data after 2009 is not comparable to data for 2009 and before due to changes in methodology.

SE.SEC.ENRL.TC.ZS,Pupil-teacher ratio in secondary education (headcount basis),"Average number of pupils per teacher at a given level of education, based on headcounts of both pupils and teachers. Divide the total number of pupils enrolled at the specified level of education by the number of teachers at the same level. In computing and interpreting this indicator, one should take into account the existence of part-time teaching, school-shifts, multi-grade classes and other practices that may affect the precision and meaningfulness of pupil-teacher ratios. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers is converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ teachers; a double-shift teacher is counted twice, etc. Teachers are defined as persons whose professional activity involves the transmitting of knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated in a formal curriculum programme to students enrolled in a formal educational institution.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics

NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD,"GDP, PPP (current international $)",PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current international dollars. For most economies PPP figures are extrapolated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) benchmark estimates or imputed using a statistical model based on the 2011 ICP. For 47 high- and upper middle-income economies conversion factors are provided by Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).,"World Bank, International Comparison Program database."
