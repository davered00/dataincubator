As a math educator, I have observed firsthand how large of a difference teacher quality can make in student learning. An "inspired" teacher will clearly be more "effective" educator. But what factors contribute most to being an "inspired" teacher? Such is the purpose of this project.

To start, we first need to define what constitutes "effective" educators. For this exploratory analysis I looked at international level and used performance on the PISA 2012 math test. As for predicting factors that might contribute to being an "inspired" teacher, I first used average teacher salaries.

Using this data, I applied a supervised learning regression model and generated two plots. "Plot1" is a matrix of scatter plots and "Plot2" is the plot of primary school teaching salary versus the PISA 2012 math test.


Future analysis will be directed at including more predictor variables such as years working as a teacher, and years of education in teaching and STEM and will be directed at a State or City level.
